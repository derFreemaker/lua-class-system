# Lua Class System

Class System in pure lua.

Works in lua `5.3+`.

The [Samples](https://github.com/derFreemaker/ClassSystem/tree/master/samples) also act as Documentation.

`class_system.lua` is the only file you need. It contains all files combined from the src folder.
It is not performance optimized at the moment.

The tests are awfully writen but work.
