# Lua Class System
Class System in pure lua.

Works in lua `5.3+`.

`class_system.lua` is the only file you need.

## Features
- Class
- Interface Class
- Constructor
- Meta Methods/Members

## TODO
- Performance improvements

## Usage
//TODO

## Third Party (only for testing)
Tests only work in `5.4` because of `<close>`.
And AI written but good enough.
